/*
1. Introduction
In this assignment, students will write a program of the voltage signal going through a LED light on the Arduino circuit. This voltage signal shows the brightness of the LED light at that time. Students will be provided with a file containing the input data. The value of the electrical resistance will be inserted in this file.

2. Input data
The input data of the program is stored in a file. This file contains the kind of int data in the following format:
R
Where:
R: the value of electrical resistance for the formula used to measure the voltage signal
The formula for the measurement of the voltage signal is as follows::
V (voltage) = R * (5.0/1023.0)

3. Output data
The program will output the brightness of the light directly to the screen depending on the voltage signal listed below

- If the voltage signal is less than 1.4. The LED light is off

- If the voltage signal is more than or equal to 1.4 and less than 2.5 volts. The LED light will have dim brightness

- If the voltage signal is more than or equal to 2.5 and less than 5 volts. The LED light will be of medium brightness

- If the voltage signal is equal to 5 volts. The LED light will be of maximum brightness

- If the voltage signal is more than 5 volts. The LED light will be short-circuited
